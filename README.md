# Monkey_Pox_Classification_Model-

### Introduction

* The Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was first discovered and reported by the Statens Serum Institut (Copenhagen, Denmark) in 1958 , after two outbreaks of the disease were discovered in cynomolgus macaques.

* The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in August 1970 from the remote town of Bokenda in the province of the equatorial of Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).


### Objective

This Prediction is a research analysis process on data using classification algorithms to compare the accuracy rate for each algorithm given below on this Monkey Pox data such as 
1. K-Neighbors Classifier
2. RandomForest Classifier
3. AdaBoost Classifier
4. Bagging Classifier
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier
6. Decision Tree Classifier

* The purpose of this research analysis is to find which model is suitable and from which algorithm it is best for the given dataset.
